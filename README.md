# Exploratory-Data-Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory data analysis - ABC company dataset

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a statistical method for summarizing the main characteristics of data sets. It often uses data visualization methods and statistical graphics. Here i have done an EDA  with a dataset from ABC company, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. The company requires a comprehensive report detailing information about their employees across various teams.

## Step 1: Import Python libraries
Import all libraries which are required for our analysis.

## Step 2: Reading dataset
Load the dataset into the analysis environment. Here i created a dataframe with the csv file.

## Step 3: Data Cleaning:
Identified and handled missing and null values in the dataset.
Checked for duplicate records.
Replaced the wrong column values with randoom values.

## Step 4: Data Analysing
Compute descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc., for numerical features.
Analyze the frequency distribution of categorical variables.
Plot histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical variables.
Visualized the frequency distribution of categorical variables using bar charts.
Determined the distribution of values using pie chart.
Identified outliers and understood the spread of numerical variables using box plots.
Computed correlations between numerical variables.
Visualized correlations between multiple numerical variables using heatmaps.

## Step 5: Data Visualization
Use various visualization techniques such as scatter plots, line plots, bar charts, etc., to visually represent patterns and insights discovered during analysis.

## Step 6: Conclusion
The Exploratory Data Analysis process provided valuable insights into the dataset, including its structure, distributions, relationships between variables, and potential areas for further investigation.
